 - main library
   - processor related
     - oprand: defines basic oprand types used in instructions
     - matcher and decoder: decodes binary instructions into opcodes and oprands
     - disassembler: translate binary instructions to (pseudo-)assembly.
     - parser: translate (pseudo-)assembly to binary instructions
     - interpreter: executes instructions
     - register: defines all register states in the processor
     - processor: wrapper of interpreter and register as a processor emulator
     - test_generator: generates test cases information for the instruction set
   - peripherals
     - AHBM: interface for accessing external memory (DSi/3DS main memory)
     - APBP: interface for communication with CPU (ARM in DSi/3DS)
     - BTDMP: audio input/output ports
     - DMA: engine for transferring large data between DSP memory and external memory
     - ICU: interrupt controller unit
     - timer
     - MMIO: I/O ports for all peripherals
     - shared_memory: the DSP working memory
     - memory_interface: the memory space exposed to the processor and related control
 - Tools
   - coff_reader: disassembles and parses symbols COFF files leaked by some DSi applications
   - dsp1_reader: disassembles DSP1 files, DSP binary for 3DS applications
   - makedsp1: assembles DSP1 files
   - test_generator: generate random test cases for processor instructions.
   - mod_test_generator & step2_test_generator: similar to test_generator, but dedicated for mod/step2 related instructions
   - test_verifier: verify test cases on the interpreter against the result generated from 3DS
